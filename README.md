1. Write a C program that accepts three integers from the user and find second largest number among these.
   Constraints: 1≤ x ≤100 1≤ y ≤100 1≤ z ≤100 Sample Date: (1 , 2, 3) -> 2 (10, 12, 24) -> 12 (34, 21, 30) -> 30

2. Write a C program that accepts two sequences ((a1, a2, .. an), (b1, b2, .. bn)) of integers as input. Find all integers that appear in both sequences, one by one, in   ascending order.
  Constraints: 1≤N1≤100, N1 -> number of integers in first sequence. 1≤N2≤100, N2 -> number of integers in second sequence. 1 ≤ ai≤ 100 ( 1 ≤ i ≤ N1 ) 1 ≤ bj≤ 100 ( 1 ≤   j ≤ N2 ) Sample Date: ( 1 2 3 1 2 3 4) -> 1 2 3 ( 1 2 3 1 2 3) -> 1 2 3 (1 2 3 4 5 6) ->

3. Write a C program that accept a sequence of different values and calculate the sum of the values before, after the maximum value. [Go to the editor] The sum of the     values before the maximum value is 0, if there are no values before the maximum. Similarly, the sum of the values after the maximum value is 0, if there are no values   after the maximum. Sample Date: 1 2 3 -> 3 0 1 2 9 4 5 -> 3 9 2 2 2 2 -> 0 6

4. Write a C program that accepts three integers A, B, X. Out of the integers between A and B (inclusive) find the smallest absolute value of difference from X. 
   Sample Date: Input A, B: 7, 11 C: 20 Smallest absolute value of difference between X and integers between A and B (inclusive): 11 Input A, B: 1, 5 C: 4 Smallest          absolute value of difference between X and integers between A and B (inclusive): 4
